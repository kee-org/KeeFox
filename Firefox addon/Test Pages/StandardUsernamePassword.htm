<body>
<div>This is a page to assist in testing KeeFox features. Submitting a variety of inputs through this form while a KeePass database is open could help identify any unexpected issues or incomplete features.</div>
<br />
<div style="font-weight:bold">This page is an example of the most common login form structure: One username field and one password field. Specifically, the username and password even use an example of common field name and field id.</div>
<br />
<div>Use the KeeFox toolbar and submit button below to test fill and save functionality. Note that the form just submits to a test results page and performs no action on the submitted data.</div>
<br />
<form action="testResults.htm" method="get">
